Arrays
In Java, arrays are a fundamental data structure that stores a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. Once an array is created, its size cannot be changed. Arrays are efficient in memory and performance but are less flexible because they require you to know the size in advance.

ArrayLists
ArrayList is a part of the Java Collections Framework and provides dynamic arrays that can grow as needed. Unlike arrays, ArrayList can change its size dynamically when elements are added or removed. ArrayList offers more flexibility but might have a slight performance overhead compared to arrays due to dynamic resizing.

Conceptual Differences
Size: Arrays are fixed, while ArrayList can grow and shrink dynamically.
Performance: Arrays are more efficient regarding memory usage and performance since they donâ€™t need to resize. ArrayList has a slight performance overhead due to its dynamic nature.
Flexibility: ArrayList provides more functionality and is easier to use when the number of elements can change, thanks to built-in methods like add(), remove(), and get().
